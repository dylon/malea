;; # Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata (MA-FSA)
;; A minimal acyclic finite-state automaton (MA-FSA), otherwise known in
;; Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and related fields as a
;; directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), stores a set of words in a
;; space-efficient manner.  The primary purpose of an MA-FSA is to facilitate
;; extremely fast lookups over a large dictionary.  Because the dictionary is
;; compressed, one should prefer an MA-FSA over a Trie for very large
;; dictionaries (unless one does not mind running out of memory).
;;
;; The algorithm was taken and modified from the following sources:
;;  - Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata (2000)
;;    - Jan Daciuk
;;    - Stoyan Mihov
;;    - Bruce W. Watson
;;    - Richard E. Watson

;; ## MA-FSA State
;; The state of a minimal acyclic finite-state automaton.  It has a list of
;; transitions to other states.  States are equivalent if they have identical
;; transitions, and each identical transition leads to identical states.
;;
;; It maintains state using the following parameters:
;;
;; 1. `:final` := Specifies whether this is an accepting state.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to false.
;; 2. `:transitions` := A mapping of labels (characters) to transition states.
;;   - Initialized to an empty map.

;; ## MA-FSA 
;; Uses the following parameters to maintain state:
;;
;; 1. `:previous-word` :=  Specifies the most recently inerserted word.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to the empty string.
;; 2. `:start-state` :=  Each word that is inserted into the MA-FSA will have its
;; first character anchored here.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an MA-FSA state having no transitions.
;; 3. `:unchecked-states` := List of states that have not been checked for
;; duplication.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an empty list.
;; 4. `:minimized-states` := Distinct states that have been checked for
;; duplication.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an empty set.  
;;  
;; The current algorithm for constructing an MA-FSA requires that the words be
;; inserted in lexicographically-increasing order.  If this invariant is not
;; maintained, then the resulting MA-FSA may not reflect accurately on the
;; initial dictionary.
