;; ## Introduction
;;
;; The algorithm for imitating Levenshtein automata was taken from the following
;; journal article:
;; 
;;     \@ARTICLE{Schulz02faststring,
;;       author = {Klaus Schulz and Stoyan Mihov},
;;       title = {Fast String Correction
;;                with Levenshtein-Automata},
;;       journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DOCUMENT
;;                  ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION},
;;       year = {2002},
;;       volume = {5},
;;       pages = {67--85}
;;     }
;; 
;; As well, this Master Thesis helped me understand its concepts:
;; 
;;   * www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/fmi/logic/theses/mitankin-en.pdf
;; 
;; The supervisor of the student who submitted the thesis was one of the
;; authors of the journal article, above.
;; 
;; The algorithm for constructing a DAWG (Direct Acyclic Word Graph) from the
;; input dictionary of words (DAWGs are otherwise known as an MA-FSA, or Minimal
;; Acyclic Finite-State Automata), was taken and modified from the following
;; blog from Steve Hanov:
;; 
;;   * http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=115
;; 
;; The algorithm therein was taken from the following paper:
;; 
;;     \@MISC{Daciuk00incrementalconstruction,
;;       author = {Jan Daciuk
;;                 and Bruce W. Watson
;;                 and Richard E. Watson
;;                 and Stoyan Mihov},
;;       title = {Incremental Construction of Minimal
;;                Acyclic Finite-State Automata},

;; ## ILevenshteinTransducer
;;
;; Protocol which must be implemented by every Levenshtein Transducer.
;;
;; ### (dictionary [this])
;;
;; DFA dictionary containing the terms that may be queried against.
;;
;; ### (index-of [this characteristic-vector k i])
;;
;; Returns the first index corresponding to a `true` value within the
;; characteristic vector, beginning at offset `i` and ending at `i + k`.  The
;; index begins at `0` for `i`, and ends at `k` for `i + k`.  If no element
;; corresponds to a `true` value within the range `i` to `i + k`, the value `-1`
;; is returned.
;;    
;; 1. `characteristic-vector` Vector of booleans corresponding to the characters
;; within the query term -- at the given offset `i` of the given length
;; `i + k` -- that match the edge-label of interest.
;; 2. `k` Number of elements to examine.
;; 3. `i` Offset of where to begin traversing the characteristic vector,
;; which must be no greater than k.
;;
;; ### (bisect-error-right [this state e l])
;;
;; Given two positions `[i,e]` and `[j,f]`, for `[i,e]` to subsume `[j,f]`, it
;; must be the case that `e < f`.  Therefore, I can remove a redundant check
;; for `e < f` within the `subsumes?` method by finding the first index that
;; contains a position having an error greater than the current one (assuming
;; that the positions are sorted in ascending order, according to error).
;;
;; ### (transition-for-position [this n])
;;
;; Returns a position transition function, which maps positions into states
;; according to the specified algorithm.
;;   
;; 1. `n` Maximum allowed edit distance.
;;   
;; A position transition function of the following signature is returned; it is
;; the heart of its respective algorithm:
;;   
;;     (fn [position characteristic-vector offset])
;;
;; The first parameter corresponds to the current position, the second
;; corresponds to a characteristic vector at the minimal boundary of the current
;; state, and the third is the offset with which to relabel the boundary of the
;; current position.
;;
;; ### (subsumes? [this i,e j,f] [this i,e,s j,f,t n] [this i,e,s j,f,t])
;;
;; Accepts the parameters of two positions, and determines whether the first
;; subsumes the second.
;;  
;; Within each algorithm-specific implementation, you will notice that I have
;; left off the essential check for (< e f).  I have derived an algorithm that
;; ensures the constraint is enforced, and I therefore do not need to check that
;; it is so.  For more details, please see my comments about
;; `bisect-error-right` and how I am using it in `unsubsume-for`.
;;
;; ### (unsubsume-for [this n])
;;
;; Returns a function that removes all the subsumed positions (unsubsumes) from
;; a state vector.  It is necessary that the state vector has had its positions
;; sorted in a particular fashion, as defined within `insert-for-subsumption`.
;;
;; TODO: Experiment with whether it is faster to perform a linear scan rather
;; than invoking a method call, to find the value for `n`.
;;
;; ### (insert-for-subsumption [this state' next-state])
;;
;; Insertion-sort according to error first, then boundary (both ascending).
;; While sorting the elements, remove any duplicates.
;;
;; ### (minimum-distance [this state w])
;;
;; The distance of each position in a state can be defined as follows, where `w`
;; is the length of the query term, `i` is the boundary of the current position,
;; and `e` is the current position's error:
;;
;;     distance = w - i + e
;;
;; It is characteristic of the generated states that `i <= w`.  Therefore,
;; `w - i` provides the number of characters remaining to be inserted before the
;; two terms are of equal lengths.  Because each insertion has a weight of `1`,
;; the number of characters remaining increases the position's current error by
;; the same number (of characters remaining).  This is the intuition behind how
;; I derived the cumulative error of the position of interest.
;;
;; For every accepting position, it must be the case that `w - i <= n - e`,
;; where `n` is the maximum allowed edit distance.  It follows directly that the
;; distance of every accepted position must be no more than `n`:
;;
;;     (w - i <= n - e) <=> (w - i + e <= n) <=> (distance <= n)
;;
;; The Levenshtein distance between any two terms is defined as the minimum edit
;; distance between them.  Therefore, iterate over each position in an accepting
;; state, and take the minimum distance among all its accepting positions as the
;; corresponding Levenshtein distance.  This is the intuition behind how I
;; derieved the minimum distance of the state of interest.
