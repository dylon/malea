;; TODO: Implement the deletion of words from the DFA.  This can be done in the
;; following fashion:
;;
;;   Transition along the DFA until the final state is encountered that
;;   corresponds to the last character of the word being deleted.  If it has no
;;   outgoing edges, delete it and all those backtracked to the root, until
;;   either another final state is encountered (for a substring) or a state
;;   having two or more outgoing edges is found.  In either case, stop the
;;   deletion but remove the label corresponding to the character of the deleted
;;   word from the state's list of outgoing edges.  In case the algorithm is
;;   able to backtrack to the root, delete the label corresponding to the first
;;   character of the deleted word from the list of outgoing edges from the
;;   root, but do not delete the root.  

;; TODO: Implement a method by which new terms may be inserted into the DFA in
;; an online fashion.

;; TODO: Implement a method by which a term may be updated, efficiently.  Rather
;; than deleting the old term and inserting the updated one, find their longest
;; common prefix, and delete everything from the old term from there; likewise,
;; insert everything corresponding to the new term, beginning at that state. 

;; # Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata (MA-FSA)
;; A minimal acyclic finite-state automaton (MA-FSA), otherwise known in
;; Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, and related fields as a
;; directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), stores a set of words in a
;; space-efficient manner.  The primary purpose of an MA-FSA is to facilitate
;; extremely fast lookups over a large dictionary.  Because the dictionary is
;; compressed, one should prefer an MA-FSA over a Trie for very large
;; dictionaries (unless one does not mind running out of memory).
;;
;; The algorithm was taken and modified from the following sources:

;; ## MA-FSA State
;; The state of a minimal acyclic finite-state automaton.  It has a list of
;; transitions to other states.  States are equivalent if they have identical
;; transitions, and each identical transition leads to identical states.
;;
;; It maintains state using the following parameters:
;;
;; 1. `final` Specifies whether this is an accepting state.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to false.
;; 2. `transitions` A mapping of labels (characters) to transition states.
;;   - Initialized to an empty map.

;; Uses the following parameters to maintain state:
;;
;; 1. `previous-word`  Specifies the most recently inerserted word.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to the empty string.
;; 2. `start-state`  Each word that is inserted into the MA-FSA will have its
;; first character anchored here.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an MA-FSA state having no transitions.
;; 3. `unchecked-states` List of states that have not been checked for
;; duplication.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an empty list.
;; 4. `minimized-states` Distinct states that have been checked for
;; duplication.
;;   - Initialized, by default, to an empty set.
;;
;; The current algorithm for constructing an MA-FSA requires that the words be
;; inserted in lexicographically-increasing order.  If this invariant is not
;; maintained, then the resulting MA-FSA may not reflect accurately on the
;; initial dictionary.
